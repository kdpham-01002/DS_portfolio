## Portfolio Projects
**[Finance Department’s New Hire Request](https://github.com/kdpham-01002/Finance-Dept-New-Hire-Request)** \| Isenberg School of Management \| Garden Grove, CA \| Fall 2024

*Technology: SQL (SQLite), Tableau (dashboards), Excel & PowerPoint (reporting)*
- Analyzed 40,000+ admissions from university’s factsheets and data table tables. Identified a 41% growth in undergraduate enrollments and identify gaps in faculty to support resource allocation for Finance Department.
- Developed dashboards to present 1000+ enrollments, integrated forecasting models leading to recommendations for hiring faculty specialized in risk management to address industry demands and enhance program prestige.

**[Unviersity Mental Health Research Study](https://github.com/kdpham-01002/University-Mental-Health-Research-Study)** \| Garden Grove, CA \| Summer 2024

*Technology: SQL (PostgreSQL), Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Statsmodels, SQLAlchemy), Git/GitHub*
- Leveraged Random Forest to predict depression scores (MSE = 17.59) and classify high-risk students (75% accuracy), providing early intervention strategies and recommendations for peer-support programs.
- Conducted statistical analysis on 200+ international students, revealing that higher social connectedness (r = -0.54, p < 0.01) strongly reduces depression, while higher acculturative stress (r = 0.41, p < 0.01) moderately increases it.

**[Data Science Interview Preps Platform](https://github.com/kdpham-01002/Data-Science-Interview-Preps-Platform)** \| Course: Web Programming \| Amherst, MA \| Fall 2021

*Technology: SQL, Python, nbconvert, HTML, CSS, VSCode (Jupyter Notebook), Git/Github*
