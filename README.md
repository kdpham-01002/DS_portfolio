- Technology: SQL (PostgreSQL), Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SciPy, Statsmodels, SQLAlchemy), Git/GitHub
- Leveraged Random Forest to predict depression scores (MSE = 17.59) and classify high-risk students (75% accuracy), providing early intervention strategies and recommendations for peer-support programs.
- Conducted statistical analysis on 200+ international students, revealing that higher social connectedness (r = -0.54, p < 0.01) strongly reduces depression, while higher acculturative stress (r = 0.41, p < 0.01) moderately increases it.

**Data Assistant** \| Center for Teaching and Learning \| Amherst, MA | Fall 2023
- Cleaned and managed survey data from daily batch updates, ensuring readiness for analysis on workshops participation data. Coordinated evaluation processes for the Distinguished Teaching Awards, supporting the recognition of over 200 professors and lecturers.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
